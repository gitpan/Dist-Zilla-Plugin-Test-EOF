NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::EOF - Check that all files in the projects
    end correctly

SYNOPSIS
      [Test::EOF]
      strict = 1

DESCRIPTION
    Generates author tests using Test::EOF. It checks that all Perl files
    end with the requested amount of new lines. It assumes that all
    linebreaks only consist of "\n". It does not check for any other line
    break character - use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::EOL for that.

  ATTRIBUTES
    The following attributes are accepted:

    "minimum_newlines"

    Default: 1

    The lowest amount of newlines acceptable at end-of-file.

    "maximum_newlines"

    Default: "minimum_newlines + 3"

    The highest amount of newlines acceptable at end-of-file.

    "strict"

    Default: 0

    If true, sets both "minimum_newlines" and "maximum_newlines" to 1. This
    option has precedence.
